'''TODO:
# implement dataloader

# random generation of initial generation

- way of selecting individuals for next generation:
	‚Äì Construct an empty new population
	‚Äì Do elitism (copy top individuals) <- experiment with fraction of individuals
	‚Äì Repeat until the new population is full:
		‚Ä¢ Select two parents from the population by roulette wheel selection
			(the probability of selecting each individual is proportional with its fitness)
		‚Ä¢ Apply one-point crossover to the two parents to generate two children
		‚Ä¢ Each child has a probability (mutation rate) to undergo flip mutation
		‚Ä¢ Put the two (mutated) children into the new population

- run for 5 generations and present results with matplotlib'
	- find good stopping criteria (or just after a certain number of generations)
	- download matplotlib
	- draw convergence curves

- abstract out code into libray for use in part 2'''
